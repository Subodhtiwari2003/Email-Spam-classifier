# Email Spam Classifier
## Project Overview
The **Email Spam Classifier** is a machine learning application designed to predict whether an email is spam or not. This project uses scikit-learn for model training, Flask for creating a web interface, and Pickle for model serialization. It provides a simple yet effective solution for filtering spam emails with ease.

## Features
- Preprocessing of email text data.
- Machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not.
- Flask-based web interface for user interaction.
- Pickle-based model loading and prediction.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model training.
- **Flask**: For building the web application.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model.
- **Text Preprocessing Techniques**: Cleaning, stemming, and feature extraction.

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   cd email-spam-classifier
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## How It Works
1. **Input**: Users input email content into the web interface.
2. **Prediction**: The application processes the input and predicts whether the email is spam or not.
3. **Output**: The classification result is displayed on the web interface.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with email servers for automated classification.
- Improved text preprocessing techniques for higher accuracy.
- Deployment using Docker or cloud services for scalability.
